# Library-Management-System

Purpose -
To create a database management system (DBMS) that enhances the efficiency with which one can use a library. 

Abstract â€“
For this project, library is a collection of books along with their related information. It is generally accessible to a limited number of people that includes the students and the faculty of a particular institution. It is always a tedious work to keep track of the available books and more often than not the customer wastes his/her time in searching for a book. I believe that this database management system will automate the operations with respect to a book in the library. This will also help the user (library manager) to access the various book details.
